# Hangman
We created Hangman using C. For understanding and Strengthening fundamentals of programming by working with string manipulation, logical desicion making, user input, character handling and modular function design
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The main functions used int he code were :
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS //used as a prevention tool for the warming messages that occur using scanf and strcpy
#include <stdio.h>  //standard input and output library
#include <string.h> //used for string manipulation (strcmp , strcopy) 
#include <ctype.h>  //used for character handling to convert text to uppercase
#include <stdlib.h> //for exit()
#include <conio.h>  //used for console output (getch())

The basic working of the program is to make a .exe file for playing hangman.
The opening file is where you input your secret_word which is the word you would be guessing the input is masked with "*" to prevent the word from getting viewed

How to run program:
Either run Hangman.C file in a compiler which creates a .exe to run said game
OR
Run the main .exe file
